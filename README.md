# tandem-tutorial-samples

This repository contains the clone of the [RW tutorial](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/tree/main/docs/docs/tutorial) (note the work `clone` rathen than `fork`, to avoid any possible damage to the original copy). 

This (tandem-samples) tutorial "lives" in main branch of this repository. All other branches (expect a lot of them) will contain slight modifications of the _original_, modified to introduce a bug or two - that will be used in the [Tandem website aplication](https://rw-community.org/) chapters [testing](https://rw-community.org/testing/introduction), [debugging](https://rw-community.org/debugging/introduction) and mostly in [how to](https://rw-community.org/cookbook/introduction), which will have specific examples for testing and debuging, using all [tools]https://rw-community.org/tools/introduction) in all contexts of interest to Redwood community members

The README in each branch other than this (which is in the main branch) will document the testing and debugging strategy as well as the solution (how the bug in this version of the tutorial is found and fixed).
