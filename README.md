# tandem-tutorial-samples

This repository contains the clone of the [RW tutorial](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/tree/main/docs/docs/tutorial) (note the work `clone` rathen than `fork`, to avoid any possible damage to the original copy).

This (tandem-samples) tutorial "lives" in **main** branch of this repository. It is the only non-modified version of the tutorial which is used to verify the correct functioning of the coomplete development environment.

All other branches (expect a lot of them) have at least one artificially created bug, needed for the readers / app developers) to practice testing and debuggin. The README.md in branches other than main explains the details of the testing and debugging needed in that branch of that tutorial source together links to matching sections of the chapter [`how to`](https://rw-community.org/cookbook/introduction) in the community owned [docs site](https://rw-community.org/).

All other branches will contain slight modifications of the _original_, modified to introduce a bug or two - that will be used in the [Tandem website aplication](https://rw-community.org/) chapters [testing](https://rw-community.org/testing/introduction), [debugging](https://rw-community.org/debugging/introduction) and mostly in [how to](https://rw-community.org/cookbook/introduction), which will have specific examples for testing and debuging, using all [tools]https://rw-community.org/tools/introduction) in all contexts of interest to Redwood community members

The README in each branch other than this (which is in the main branch) will document the testing and debugging strategy as well as the solution (how the bug in this version of the tutorial is found and fixed).
